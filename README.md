# üìÅ Welcome to the FSARO Website Repository!
The FSARO (otherwise known as the Freefall Softworks Archival Organization) is a collective organization of people who aim to archive all prevalent items surrounding the developemnt group Freefall Softworks by Cishahto. Our goal is to create a comprehensive archive service, similar to that of the Wayback Machine‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, that contains all major news, videos, asset IDs, in-game music, events, and more.

This repository was made to host our GitHub Pages website, developed by Chordavei (@chordavei) and Jake (@somerandomguyonhere). As of 1/9/2025, the website is being rebranded and rebuilt to a newer version. Please note that our website and material is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0, meaning you must follow the directions of the license to fork this repository and/or use our material.

If you are looking for the FSDMC (Freefall Softworks Datamining Collective), it has rebranded and merged with FSARO. The previous URLs for FSDMC will redirect here soon and emails sent to contact@fsdmc.us.to will not be responded to. If you wish to contact us, you may do so via Discord or X.

Our beautified changelogs are in the works! Please hang tight as we make them!
