## About this Repository:
This repository houses the homepage and all subpages of the FSARO website.

## Missions and Goals:
While many proclaim that whatever is posted to the internet is forever, that is only applicable in some cases. Many websites or people may delete content that people want to find, or said content may become difficult to track down. To combat this and keep an extensive record, many websites, such as the Wayback Machine®️, are made to document and allow anyone to access old content. However, this process is mostly manual, as the data crawlers that automate data collection cannot access certain content, meaning some data is not found. This is what the FSARO aims to fix. Focused on the game development studio Freefall Softworks by Cishshato, we aim to archive anything and everything. We accomplish this with a team of archivers that search and index Freefall Softworks related content, who then enter it into a comprehensive database that anyone can use. This means that more data can be indexed, including hard-to-find data.

## Copyright and Intellectual Property
Our mission may bring concerns to some individuals about Copyright. The FSARO fully abides by Copyright law, and does not sell or lend any material we archive. Owners of copyrighted material may also contact us to remove or set restrictions on their property. People who may have their information leaked can also remove certain materials from the archive.

## Further Development
At the moment, we currently only document items related to Freefall Softworks. In the future however, we envision our archive to be en extensive list of materials for all Robhlox-based heist-related games.

## Volunteer Support
We are currently accepting volunteers. You may apply at our [Discord](https://fsaro.github.io/discord) or by emailing us through our contact email.
