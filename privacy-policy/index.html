    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p> Effective on October 28, 2024 </p>
    <p>Freefall Softworks Archival Organization (“FSARO”, “the collective”) values and respects its users’ privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) serves to protect the data of the user. This Policy shall outline the collection of data that occurs by the collective, and will describe what can and cannot be done with your data.</p>
    
    <p> We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at any time. We will attempt to inform users, however, it is the responsibility of the user to read this Policy frequently and not the fault of the collective if the user fails to do so. </p>
    
    <p> This policy applies to Freefall Softworks Archival Organization, otherwise known as “FSARO” or “the collective”, and all of its services. Through the use of our website, located at fsaro.github.io, alongside any other services that FSARO may offer, such as the archive and models database, you (“the user”) are hereby consenting to this Policy in its entirety.</p>
    
    <p>Please note that this Policy is not applicable to services outside of those owned by FSARO or other people not employed or managed by the collective. If the collective is to mention an external website in any way, you must ensure that you educate yourself upon the external site’s Privacy Policy, alongside any other documents they provide. </p>
    
    <p>This Policy is structured to inform you of the following information:</p>
    <p>The data we collect</p>
    <p>Data retention periods and storage</p>
    <p>How data is shared with external services</p>
    <p>What choices are available to you concerning your data</p>
    <p>The security procedures in place safeguard your data</p>
    <p>Data handling by third-party companies used by the collective</p>
    
    <p>THE DATA WE COLLECT:</p>
    <p>It is your choice to use our services. If you refuse to share data with the collective, we have the right to refuse certain services to you, which is under the discretion of the collective.</p>
    
    <p>The collective makes no attempt to record personally-identifiable information. Should the collective hold such data, it is the responsibility of the user to request deletion.</p>
    
    <p>If you choose to publish information to the collective’s public archive of 3-dimensional models (“models database”) service provided by the collective, we reserve the right to assign you a uniquely identifiable string (“user key”) for each entry of information to the database. The user key contains both letters, numbers, and special characters, and is not traceable to the users’ location or specific identifying information, and only serves the purpose to identify information and its publisher anonymously within our systems. If you are not comfortable with this action, then you will be allowed to use the models database, but not upload any information to it.</p>
    
    <p>The collective also collects anonymized data on the number of unique visitors and countries in which our website has been requested to be accessed in. These analytics are anonymous and contain no personally-identifiable information.</p>
    
    <p>Information from log-in pages and other pages that require sensitive info is also collected and stored. Emails addressed to the collective, including to the email contact@fsaro.github.io will also be stored.</p>
    
    <p>DATA RETENTION PERIODS AND STORAGE:</p>
    <p>The collective has separate protocols that define how long data is retained for certain information. Emails addressed to the collective, including through the email address contact@fsaro.github.io, will be stored for a minimum of 2 years, and may be stored longer if not requested to be deleted. Each user key will be stored indefinitely, unless removal is specifically requested or the information to which the user key is linked to is deleted. For data that we are legally obliged to retain, we will store it only for the required time period.</p>
    
    <p>The user’s data is stored on a multitude of platforms, including servers that are not owned by FSARO. While the collective has the ability to modify data on the servers, we are not responsible for data storage issues, including security and encryption, when data is being stored at an external service.</p>
    
    <p>The collective does not target or wish to collect the data of children under the age of thirteen (13). If a minor under the age of thirteen (13) is to use our services, they confirm that they have obtained permission from their legal guardian, and the legal guardian agrees to bind themselves to this Policy until the child has reached the age of thirteen (13), at which point the child is legally bound by this policy if use of services is continued.</p>
    
    <p>HOW DATA IS SHARED WITH EXTERNAL SERVICES:</p>
    <p>The collective does not participate in the sale of user data. Therefore, the collective has the right to refuse information to external parties unless approved by the user.</p>
    
    <p>Please note carefully that the collective may be legally bound by the United States Federal law to provide information to other third parties that the collective does not wish to share information with. In such a case, the collective cannot be held at liability for any damages caused by such actions. The collective will only offer information to third parties that formally request so in the United States Federal Court, and for the transfer of information to occur, the Federal Court must declare that we are required to hand over said information. The collective will not offer other countries data, even if they are affiliated with the United States of America, unless the user explicitly consents to share said information, or the country pursues action in the United States Federal Court. The collective may attempt to counter-claim any requests for data, but cannot guarantee that it will succeed in doing so, if attempted.Please note carefully that the collective may be legally bound by the United States Federal law to provide information to other third parties that the collective does not wish to share information with.
